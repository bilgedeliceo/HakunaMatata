# Usage and Effectiveness of Mental Health Apps

An important component of wellbeing is mental health, and technological developments have resulted in the creation of mental health apps as a tool for those looking to manage their mental health and enhance their well-being. Mnetal health apps provide several services, such as exercises in mindfulness, stress management, and mood tracking. Recently, there has been an increase in the use of mental health apps, and there is growing curiosity about how effectively these apps work as a tool for mental health and wellbeing.

The science of psychology has only matured in the last century. As a result, the worldwide mental health system has limited resources still today. That is why the ease of accessibility of mental health apps is one of its main advantages. A smartphone or tablet can be used to access mental health apps at any time and from any location. As a result, people have access to resources and help whenever they need it for managing their mental health. People who reside in rural or remote places or who are unable to obtain conventional face to face mental health care because of unavailability, stigma, or other obstacles may find this to be extremely helpful.

Face to face mental services can be very expensive and that is where mental health apps can be an affordable replacement. Receiving mental help just one time is never enough to heal the patient. Costs of psychological therapy are not covered by the insurance in most countries. People from low socioeconomic backgrounds may not be able to afford mental health services. It is therefore important to pursue other forms of treatment for anxiety and depression, and e-mental health services offer the potential to address many of these reasons.

The individualized support that mental health applications offer is another advantage. Individuals can measure their mood and well-being over time with the help of the mood tracking features found in many mental health apps. Using this data, you may develop a personalized strategy for managing your mental health that includes advice on mindfulness exercises, stress-reduction methods, and other methods for enhancing wellbeing. Additionally, some apps provide stress-reduction strategies and mindfulness exercises that may be customized to each user's requirements and tastes.

According to research, using mental health apps can help people feel better mentally. According to one study, people who used mental health apps reported much fewer symptoms of anxiety and sadness than those who did not (Richardson et al., 2010). According to a different study, those who used a mental health app to monitor their mood reported feeling better about themselves and having more control over their mental health (Andrews et al., 2010). However, it's crucial to remember that not all mental health apps work equally well. These apps' quality and effectiveness can differ, so it's important to pick one that's suitable for your individual needs and has been shown to be efficient. 

It's not simple to pick a mental health app. There are more than 50,000 health-related applications accessible in the Google Play Store, and the majority of them are not only not useful but sometimes occasionally dangerous to users who want to enhance their mental health. Before being posted on any app store, the content of mental health apps is not reviewed. Users are in charge of selecting the app that best suits their mental illness while exercising extra caution to ensure the content is supported by science. The patient may have catastrophes as a result of improper mental health app counseling, just like with any medical intervention (Alyami et al., 2017).

The effectiveness of mental health apps as a whole is still not well understood. The health authorities haven't issued many criteria for evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of health-related apps. The vast majority of studies on mental health applications are conducted by people and businesses that are involved in their creation. As a result, the literature is conflicted. For instance, studies have shown that the amount of contact with an app predicts improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms (Bakker and Rickard, 2018). However, some research have suggested that getting participants to interact with their smartphone or the "digital placebo effect" alone may be enough to cause symptom decreases (Torous and Firth, 2016).

The long term sustainability of the advantages of mental health apps should be taken into account. While there are many short term advantages to using these applications, long term improvement and maintenance of mental health depend on the maintenance of healthy practices. According to research, using mental health apps can help people maintain better mental health over time, although this depends on the user's capacity to develop and uphold wholesome routines (Richardson et al., 2010). 
 
Security and privacy issues are a problem with the use of mental health apps. Apps for mental health frequently gather private data, such as details on mood, thoughts, and actions. To secure personal information, it's critical to pick an app with strict privacy and security standards. It's also critical to think about how data gathered by mental health apps will be stored and shared, as well as to comprehend the advantages and disadvantages of data sharing.

The risk of injury associated with using mental health applications is another issue. While many mental health applications provide a number of advantages, some may also provide information or advice that is harmful or not supported by any available evidence. It's crucial to pick an app that has been shown to be efficient and is founded on concepts supported by evidence..

Finally, there is a huge need for more study on mental health apps. Apps for managing mental health can be helpful, but it's important to choose the ideal one for your needs and understand their limitations. Since there are currently few mental health applications with expert input, mental health professionals need to be more involved in the app development process to increase the quality of these apps. The most effective methods for maintaining mental health ultimately involve self-care, professional treatment, and the use of resources like mental health apps. Furthermore, it is not recommended to substitute expert mental health care with mental health apps.
